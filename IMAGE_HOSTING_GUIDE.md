# Image Hosting Guide for Poorva Good Luck Web App

## Current Issue

We've encountered challenges with pushing large image files to GitHub due to their size. The project contains several high-resolution images in the `public/images` directory that are too large to be efficiently pushed to GitHub.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Image Optimization (Recommended)

Before deploying, optimize the images to reduce their file size:

1. Use an online tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress the images
2. Replace the original images in `public/images` with the optimized versions
3. Aim for file sizes under 1MB per image if possible

### Option 2: External Image Hosting

Host the images on an external service and update the references in `content.ts`:

1. Upload images to a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), or [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/)
2. Update the image paths in `src/data/content.ts` to point to the external URLs
3. Example:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 1,
     src: "https://example-host.com/your-image.jpg", // External URL instead of /images/your-image.jpg
     alt: "Poorva with friends",
     note: "Friends are just family you choose. You'll find your new family abroad too!"
   }
   ```

### Option 3: Git LFS (Git Large File Storage)

For long-term projects that need version control for large files:

1. Install Git LFS from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Set up Git LFS for the repository:
   ```
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "public/images/*.jpg" "public/images/*.jpeg" "public/images/*.png"
   git add .gitattributes
   ```
3. Commit and push as normal (Git LFS will handle the large files)

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to Vercel or Netlify:

1. If using optimized local images (Option 1), they should deploy normally once their size is reduced
2. If using external image hosting (Option 2), deployment should be smooth as the large files aren't in the repository
3. If using Git LFS (Option 3), ensure your deployment platform supports Git LFS

## Current Status

- The code with correct image paths has been updated in the repository
- The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude large image files
- Local development works correctly with images in `public/images`
- For production deployment, implement one of the solutions above

## Next Steps

1. Choose one of the image hosting solutions above
2. Implement the chosen solution
3. Deploy the application to Vercel or Netlify
4. Verify that images load correctly in production

## Note

The local development server will continue to work with the current setup as it reads the images directly from the `public/images` directory on your local machine.
